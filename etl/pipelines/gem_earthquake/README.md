# Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Earthquakes

Maps of peak ground acceleration, supplied by the GEM project.

Unfortunately these files are not available publically on the internet, and so
must be sourced directly from GEM and placed into the appropriate location, i.e.
`raster/raw/gem_earthquake/` prior to processing.
