# Cooling Degree Days, difference between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming scenarios

Changes in Cooling Degree Days (CDD) between the 1.5°C and 2.0°C global warming scenarios

These files contain the absolute and relative mean increase of cooling degree
days (CDDs) from 1.5°C to 2°C global warming scenarios. Additionally, the
standard deviation is provided. The data has a horizontal resolution of 0.833
longitude and 0.556 latitude over the land surface. These annual CDDs and
standard deviation globally were calculated using an ensemble of 700 simulations
per climate change scenario. Cooling degree days (CDDS) were calculated for the
ensemble members using the temperature threshold of 18°C. Then, annual mean CDDs
and standard deviation per coordinate across ensemble members were obtained for
the 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios. Finally, absolute and relative differences between
1.5°C and 2°C were computed. The climate data, involving 700 simulations per
scenario, was generated using the HadAM4P Atmosphere-only General Circulation
Model (AGCM) from the UK Met Office Hadley Centre. Three scenarios were
generated: historical (2006-16), 1.5°C and 2°C. The simulation outputs were mean
temperatures with a 6-hour timestep and a horizontal resolution of 0.833
longitude and 0.556 latitude. Simulations took place within
climateprediction.net (CPDN) climate simulation, which uses the Berkeley Open
Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) framework. Biases in simulated
temperature were identified and corrected using a quantile mapping approach.
