# ESA Landcover

Categorical data originally supplied in netcdf format: `C3S-LC-L4-LCCS-Map-300m-P1Y-2020-v2.1.1.nc`

**NOTE**: This dataset may fail to load into a cloud-hosted database due to its
size (the connection in Terracotta drops before the ingest completes.) The
work-around is to load it to a local database, then replicate the database
remotely.
