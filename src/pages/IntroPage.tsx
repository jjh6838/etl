    <h1>Jamaica Systemic Risk Assessment Tool</h1>

    <p>This prototype tool presents infrastructure risk analytics for
    Jamaica.</p>

    <Alert severity="info">The systemic risk analysis results shown in this
    tool contain licensed data that must not be shared outside the Government of
    Jamaica. By accessing the tool, you acknowledge that you understand this and
    agree not to download any data or share your access credentials with anyone
    else.</Alert>

    <p>The modelling and analysis presented here aim to support climate
    adaptation decision-making by identifying spatial criticalities and risks
    under current and future hazard scenarios. It comprises a direct damage
    estimation and an indirect economic loss estimation of GDP disruptions due
    to asset failures and service disruption.</p>

    <p>
      This research is led by researchers in the Oxford Programme for Sustainable Infrastructure Systems in the
      Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford, for the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) as part of a project
      funded by UK Aid (FCDO). The initiative forms part of the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investmentâ€™s (CCRI)
      collaboration with the GoJ, which includes analysis of nature-based approaches to build resilience in Jamaica to
      be procured and funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF).
