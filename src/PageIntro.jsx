  <h1>Jamaica Infrastructure Risk Assessment Tool</h1>

  <p>This prototype tool presents infrastructure risk analytics for Jamaica.</p>

  <p>The modelling and analysis presented here aim to support climate adaptation
  decision-making by identifying spatial criticalities and risks under current
  and future hazard scenarios. It comprises a direct damage estimation and an
  indirect economic loss estimation of GDP disruptions due to asset failures and
  service disruption.</p>

  <h2>Funding support</h2>

  <p>This research is led by researchers in the Oxford Programme for Sustainable
  Infrastructure Systems in the Environmental Change Institute, University of
  Oxford, for the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) as part of a project funded by UK
  Aid (FCDO). The initiative forms part of the Coalition for Climate Resilient
  Investmentâ€™s (CCRI) collaboration with the GoJ, which includes analysis of
  nature-based approaches to build resilience in Jamaica to be procured and
  funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF).</p>
